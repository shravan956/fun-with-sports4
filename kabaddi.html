        <h2>History of Kabaddi</h2>
        <p>Kabaddi originated in India over 4,000 years ago. It was traditionally played as a game of strength and endurance between two teams Origin
            Kabaddi is an ancient Indian game that is believed to have originated in Tamil Nadu over 4,000 years ago. It was likely invented to help people develop defensive skills against group attacks. 
            Early history
            Some say that the game was played by Gautama Buddha for recreation. The ancient Indian epic Mahabharata describes a battle where Abhimanyu, the heir of the Pandava Kings, played Kabaddi. 
            Modern Kabaddi
            The first known rules for Kabaddi were created in Maharashtra in 1921. The game became popular in India and parts of South Asia in the 1930s. 
            International exposure
            Kabaddi gained international recognition at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. It was included in the Indian Olympic Games in 1938. In 1990, it became part of the Beijing Asian Games, which helped popularize it as a competitive sport. 
            Other countries
            In addition to India, Kabaddi is also played in many other countries, including Sri Lanka, Japan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Oman, South Korea, Thailand, Iran, and Pakistan.
