            <h2>About Table Tennis</h2>
            <p>Table Tennis, also known as Ping Pong, is a fast-paced indoor sport played between two or four players. The objective is to score points by hitting a lightweight ball over a net onto the opponent's side of the table using a small racket. It is played at both recreational and competitive levels and is one of the most popular indoor sports worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Score points by hitting the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Match Duration:</strong> A game is typically played to 11 points, with players switching sides after each game. Matches can be best of 3, 5, or 7 games.</li>
                <li><strong>Serving:</strong> The serve must start from behind the end line, and the ball must bounce once on the server's side and once on the opponent's side.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> A point is won when the opponent fails to return the ball within the table's boundaries or commits a fault.</li>
                <li><strong>Faults:</strong> A fault is committed if the ball doesn't bounce on the opponent's side, or if the player touches the table with their free hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Rackets:</strong> Players use paddles (rackets) covered with rubber. Both sides can be used for different strokes, usually one for forehand and the other for backhand.</li>
            </ul>
