            <h2>What is Football?</h2>
            <p>Football (also known as soccer in some countries) is a sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is to score by getting a ball into the opposing team's goal.</p>
            <p>Learn the rules and gameplay fundamentals below.</p>

            <h1>The Football Field</h1>
            <p>The field is rectangular, typically 100-110 meters long and 64-75 meters wide. It is divided into two halves, with a goal at each end. The center spot is where the game begins.</p>

            <h1>Basic Football Rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> A match consists of two 45-minute halves, with a 15-minute break.</li>
                <li><strong>Offside:</strong> A player is offside if they are nearer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender when the ball is played to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Kicks:</strong> Free kicks are awarded for fouls. They can be direct (allowing a shot at goal) or indirect (must touch another player before scoring).</li>
                <li><strong>Throw-ins:</strong> When the ball crosses the touchline, the team that didn’t touch it last gets possession. The ball is thrown back into play from the point where it went out.</li>
            </ul>
